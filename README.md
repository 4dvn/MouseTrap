# MouseTrap
This is an implementation of Bastille's exploit [MouseJack](https://github.com/BastilleResearch/mousejack) using [JackIt's](https://github.com/insecurityofthings/jackit) exploit code. Full credit goes to them for discovering this issue and writing the libraries to work with the CrazyRadio PA dongle, as well as the implementation that I have created a Ducky Script for. For more information about the vulnerability, as well as vulnerable devices, check out their Github repositories!
## What is MouseTrap?
MouseTrap is a Ducky Script I have written for MouseJack that allows a user to disable firewalls, active monitoring, and install a backdoor remotely through a victim's wireless mouse. In roughly 10 seconds, you can have a meterpreter session running without firewall interruption.
